Subject: [ANNOUNCE] %FORMAL_NAME% elected as CouchDB committer
================================================================================

Dear community,

I am pleased to announce that the CouchDB Project Management Committee has elected %FORMAL_NAME% as a CouchDB committer.

    Apache ID: %APACHE_ID%

    IRC nick: %IRC_NICK%

By default, external contributions to the project follow the Review-Then-Commit model. Being a committer means you can follow the Commit-Then-Review model. In other words, %INFORMAL_NAME% can now make changes at will.

This election was made in recognition of %INFORMAL_NAME%'s existing contributions and commitment to the project.

Please join me in extending a warm welcome to %INFORMAL_NAME%!

On behalf of the CouchDB PMC,
