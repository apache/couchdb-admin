Subject: [VOTE] Elect %NAME% as committer
================================================================================

Dear PMC,

I would like to elect %NAME% as committer.

%REASONS%

A successful election would signify that the PMC trusts this person to be loyal to the project and its interests. This includes a binding vote in project decisions and write access to project infrastructure.

Required reading:

    https://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#committers

Per the bylaws, this vote uses the lazy majority approval model, meaning that three binding +1 votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes are needed.

Please cast your votes now.

Thanks,
