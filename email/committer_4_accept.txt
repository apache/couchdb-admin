Dear %NAME%,

Welcome. Here are the next steps.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has been recorded. After this we will make an announcement to the dev@couchdb.apache.org list, and your new position will be official.

You will receive a few emails from various different people as this process moves forward. You will also be given commit access half way through this process, but please do not make any commits until your new position has been announced. Remember that CouchDB follows a Review-Then-Commit process; this does not change once given direct commit access.

In response to this email, please indicate:

 * Your IRC nick (if you have one)
 * Your Twitter account (if you have one)

Please work your way through:
