Subject: Next steps as a new committer
================================================================================

Dear %NAME%,

As you know, %ID% is your new committer account.

You now have write access to certain parts of the ASF.

Don't forget to work your way through the steps here:

    https://s.apache.org/couchdb-committer-first-steps

While all of the items are important, we want to remind you of three specific ones that are key.

We abide by a code of conduct and a set of bylaws. You should familiarise yourself with both documents. As a committer, people will look to you for cues about how to act. Please help us set the right standard.

    https://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html

    https://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html

You will want to complete the Git / GitHub / ASF integration step for the best experience when committing to our repositories:

    https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the CouchDB dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers and can be out-of-date or incomplete. Please help us fix that!

Thanks,
