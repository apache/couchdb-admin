Subject: [DISCUSS] Archive Apache CouchDB 1.2.1
================================================================================

Dear community,

I would like to archive Apache CouchDB %VERSION%.

Reasons:

 * %REASON%

Archiving this release means that we no longer support it, and we will remove any references to it from our website and our wiki. However, the original files will still be available to anyone browsing the release archives.

For more information, see:

    http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/CurrentReleases#Archived_Releases

You do not need to respond if you are in agreement. If there is no response in 72 hours, I will assume lazy consensus.

If we reach consensus, I archive the release.

Thanks,
