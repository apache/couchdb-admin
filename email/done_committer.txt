Subject: Next steps as a new committer
================================================================================

Dear %NAME%,

As you know, %ID% is your new committer account.

You now have write access to certain parts of the ASF.

A guide for your first steps as a committer can be found here:

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Committer+First+Steps

The CouchDB community guide can be found here:

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Community+Guide

General committers resources are here:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

We abide by a code of conduct and a set of bylaws. You should familiarise yourself with both documents. As a committer, people will look to you for cues about how to act. Please help us set the right standard.

View those documents here:

    http://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html

    http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html

One of the first things you should do with your new commit bit is to add yourself to the AUTHORS file on the master branch of the primary CouchDB Git repository. Furthermore, please add yourself to the committers list at https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Committers. Though please wait for my public announcement before you do so.

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the CouchDB dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers and can be out-of-date or incomplete. Please help us fix that!

Thanks,
