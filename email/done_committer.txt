Subject: Next steps as a new committer
================================================================================

Dear %NAME%,

As you know, the ASF Infrastructure has set up your committer account as %ID%.

Please log in and configure your account, if you haven't already done so:

    https://id.apache.org/

You can use this to set up SSH, GPG, mail forwarding, etc.

More information here:

    http://www.apache.org/dev/#committers

You now have commit access to specific parts of the ASF.

CouchDB resources are here:

    http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/SourceCode

General committers resources are here:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

One of the first things you should do with your new commit bit is to add yourself to the AUTHORS file on the master branch of the primary CouchDB Git repository.

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the CouchDB dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers and hence can be out-of-date or incomplete. Of course, you can now help fix that!

I will announce you to the dev list soon.

Thanks,
