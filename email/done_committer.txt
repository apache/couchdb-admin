Subject: Next steps as a new committer
================================================================================

Dear %NAME%,

As you know,  %ID% is your new committer account.

Please log in and configure your account, if you haven't already done so:

    https://id.apache.org/

You can use this to set up SSH, GPG, mail forwarding, etc. You should
consider creating a dedicated release/code signing GPG key bound to
your ASF id.

You now have commit access to certain parts of the ASF.

CouchDB resources are here:

A Guide for your first steps as a commiter can be found here:

    https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Committer_First_Steps

General committers resources are here:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

One of the first things you should do with your new commit bit is to add yourself to the AUTHORS file on the master branch of the primary CouchDB Git repository. Furthermore, please add yourself to the committers list at https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Committers. Though please wait for my public announcement before you do so.

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the CouchDB dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers and can be out-of-date or incomplete. Please help us fix that!

Thanks,
