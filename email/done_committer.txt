Subject: Next steps as a new committer
================================================================================

Dear %NAME%,

As you know, %ID% is your new committer account.

You now have write access to certain parts of the ASF.

A guide for your first steps as a committer can be found here:

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Committer+First+Steps

If you intend to contribute to Apache CouchDB's version-controlled
repositories, and have a GitHub account, We strongly urge you to complete
the GitHub/ASF integration process here:

    https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/

The CouchDB community guide can be found here:

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Community+Guide

General ASF committers resources are here:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

We abide by a code of conduct and a set of bylaws. You should familiarise yourself with both documents. As a committer, people will look to you for cues about how to act. Please help us set the right standard.

View those documents here:

    http://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html

    http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the CouchDB dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers and can be out-of-date or incomplete. Please help us fix that!

Thanks,
