Subject: Re: Invitation to become a CouchDB committer: %NAME%

Dear %NAME%,

Welcome. Here are the next steps.

You need to send a Contributor License Agreement to the ASF. Normally you would send an Individual CLA. If you also make contributions done in work time or using work resources then see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any questions about this.

Find out how to do this here:

    http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user ID, along with some alternatives.

In order to ensure your ID available, you can view a list of taken IDs at:

    http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

Please notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means  you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has been recorded. After this we will make an announcement to the dev@couchdb.apache.org list, and your new position will be official.

Please do not make any commits until your new position has been announced.

Some required reading, in the meantime:
