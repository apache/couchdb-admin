Subject: [VOTE] Elect %NAME% as PMC member
================================================================================

Dear PMC,

I would like to elect %NAME% as a PMC member.

%REASONS%

A successful election would signify that the PMC trusts this person sufficiently to represent the project at the highest level, and to participate in all project decision-making activities.

Required reading:

    http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#pmc

Per the bylaws, this vote uses the lazy 2/3 majority approval model, meaning that three binding +1 votes and twice as many binding +1 votes as binding -1 votes are needed.

Please cast your votes now.

Thanks,
