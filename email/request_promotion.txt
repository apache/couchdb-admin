================================================================================

Dear community,

Being a volunteer organisation, we rely on you to help us promote releases.

Here is the official blog post:

    %BLOG_URL%

Here is the official tweet:

    %TWEET_URL%

And Google+ post:

    %GOOGLE_URL%

We also have a Hacker News item:

    %HN_URL%

And several Reddit items:

    %REDDIT_URLS%

Please take a moment to share these links with your friends.

Retweet us if you use Twitter, and upvote us if you use Google+, Hacker News, or Reddit.

(Note that Hacker News users may want to navigate to the item from the front page. I believe up votes are not counted when you link to an item directly.)

If you have any other promotion you'd like to highlight, please reply to this thread.

Thanks,
